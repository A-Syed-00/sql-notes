My SQL study notes and practice queries 


This repository contains my personal SQL study notes and practice queries.  
It’s a combination of reference material, worked examples, and exercises I’ve completed while learning SQL.
I’m using **Mode** (PostgreSQL syntax) and **Google BigQuery** (Standard SQL) for practice, so notes may reflect both.
